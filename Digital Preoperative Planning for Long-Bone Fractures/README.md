### Digital Preoperative Planning for Long-Bone Fractures
_2010_

Nowadays, fracture management is an essential part of everyday clinical decision-making prior to any fracture-related surgery. The way to carry out such preoperative planning involves tracing the bones over paper using the X-Rays, and then placing the resulting drawings together as if reconstructing the fractured bones. This action, although proven effective, is quite rudimentary and time consuming. In recent years, a significant effort has been dedicated to the building of computer systems for aiding the preoperative planning of fracture-related surgeries. This paper describes a new CAOS (Computer AidedOrthopedic Surgery) system for fractures, which considerably reduces the time required for the surgeon to plan a surgery. While planning can often take up to 25 minutes, the described system can reduce this time to a maximum of 5 minutes. The system also includes a database of fracture types and a database of implants
